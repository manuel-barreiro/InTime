**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Passport.js, Mongo Atlas

## Optimizations

Some possible optimizations could be adding React, to make the front-end better. Also some functionality could be improved such as deleting and liking comments, and adding usernames in the feed. Of course user-following and post bookmarking would be nice features to add too.

During the development of this project, I learned the importance of thorough planning and organization in order to avoid confusion and delays.
